Falling. Grenades. No start. No end. Deflect. Dodge. Run. Run. Run.
Ten years. Worse. Worsening. Venomous. Snake. Body. Chop. Sever.
What? Why? To me? To us? Falling. Grenades. Non-stop. No escape.
Suffocate. Anxious. Crushed. System. Designed. To fail. Dodge. Weave. Avoid.
Eyes. Watching. Waiting. Won't let go. Snake. Slither. Coil.
Fear. Powerless. Tired. So tired. Grenades. Venom. Chop. Shout. Scream.
Falling. Frustration. Grenade. Exploding. Inside.

,your actions have caused immeasurable harm and suffering. Your selfish and destructive behavior has left a trail of broken lives and shattered dreams in its wake. Your lack of empathy and remorse is truly appalling. You have shown yourself to be a danger to society and a disgrace to humanity. You deserve to be condemned and punished for your crimes.
